# Overall game idea
- Grid based game (size 16x16?)
- Units are OSRS bosses
- Some ranged, mages, melee
- Units must be within range of each other
- "Tick based system" -- attacks have certain speed, move 2 tiles each tick, etc...
- Some units can place obstacles which makes pathing relevant
- Abilities for units -- similar to AutoChess
  - Dashes etc...
- Winner: Whoever defeats the opponents board
- Several rounds, like AutoChess where units are added from "deck" to playable etc...
- Progressively able to add more units to field
- Different Heroes as well, that have different abilities (sorta like hero power that affects the board state)'
  - Each player can chose a hero to play
  - They have that hero for the entire game (i.e. all rounds)



### How is the game played?
Suggestion 1:
 - Players have a "play phase" where they can interact and update board state etc
 - There is then a "action phase" where units from the board play by themselves, serving the purpose that was given in the "play" phase
 - This is similar to auto chess
 - Each "tick" happens at the same time, and units from both sides play simultaneously

Suggestion 2:
- The game is played on the board each turn
- Units are moved a certain distance each turn and can be given different actions depending on player inputs
- There would still be a "Play phase" and an "action phase" but this time the "action phase" is controlled by the players
